## Install
This is a work in progress and for now you'll haev to download manually and install. Once its at a stable point I'll add it to the Atom.io packages. 

Soon ... 

Open Atom Preferences, select Themes > Search for `Glacier-Syntax-Theme`,
then Install.

*You may need to reload Atom `Cmd+R` in between these steps.*

Activate the theme by selecting the Themes section of Preferences.
